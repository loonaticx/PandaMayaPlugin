# PandaMayaPlugin

A modified version of Panda3D Maya Tools with custom object types to help expedite some of the processes required to get models game-ready.

These tools are made specifically around development for Toontown content. Some of the egg-type attributes available prior have been commented out for ease of use.

There are a few egg-type attributes that will not automatically register when importing in bam or egg files. Specifically, some intended for tube object types or DCS object types do not automatically get picked up and need to be manually re-applied in the Add Egg Object-Types menu.
