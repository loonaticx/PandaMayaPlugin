#   It is sometimes important to control the order in which objects
#   are rendered, particularly when transparency is in use.  In Panda,
#   this is achieved via the use of named bins and, within certain
#   kinds of bins, sometimes an explicit draw-order is also used (see
#   below).
#   In the normal (state-sorting) mode, Panda renders its geometry by
#   first grouping into one or more named bins, and then rendering the
#   bins in a specified order.  The programmer is free to define any
#   number of bins, named whatever he/she desires.
#   This scalar specifies which bin this particular polygon is to be
#   rendered within.  If no bin scalar is given, or if the name given
#   does not match any of the known bins, the polygon will be assigned
#   to the default bin, which renders all opaque geometry sorted by
#   state, followed by all transparent geometry sorted back-to-front.
#   Define a "ground" type, for rendering ground surfaces immediately
#   behind the drop shadows.
egg-object-type-ground          <Scalar> bin { ground }
egg-object-type-shground        <Tag> cam { shground }

#   Define a "shadow" object type, so we can render all shadows in their
#   own bin and have them not fight with each other (or with other
#   transparent geometry).
egg-object-type-shadow          <Scalar> bin { shadow } <Scalar> alpha { blend-no-occlude }

#   This works in conjunction with bin to further refine the
#   order in which this polygon is drawn, relative to other geometry
#   in the same bin.  If (and only if) the bin type named in the bin
#   scalar is a CullBinFixed, this draw-order is used to define the
#   fixed order that all geometry in the same will be rendered, from
#   smaller numbers to larger numbers.
#   If the draw-order scalar is specified but no bin scalar is
#   specified, the default is a bin named "fixed", which is a
#   CullBinFixed object that always exists by default.
